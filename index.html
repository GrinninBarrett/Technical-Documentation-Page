    <article>
      <p>In this article we cover the absolute basics of HTML. To get you
        started, this article defines elements, attributes, and all the other
        important terms you may have heard. It also explains where these fit
        into HTML. You will learn how HTML elements are structured, how a
        typical HTML page is structured, and other important basic language
        features. Along the way, there will be an opportunity to play with HTML
        too!</p>

    <header>What is HTML?</header>
    <article>
      <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">HTML</a>
        (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is
        a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages
         you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer
         wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use
         to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it
         appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content
         into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so
         on.  For example, consider the following line of text:</p>
      <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
      <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is
        a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph element:</p>
      <code>&ltp&gtMy cat is very grumpy&#60p&#62</code>
    </article>

    <article>
      <p>Let's further explore our paragraph element from the
        previous section:</p>
      <img class="anatomy-diagram" src="images/code-example-1.png" alt="example of opening and
      closing paragraph tags in html">
      <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this
          example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle
          brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts
          to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the
          paragraph text.</li>
        <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element.
          In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
        <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening
          tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name.
           This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag
           is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by
        the closing tag.</p>

    <article>
      <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting.
        If we wanted to state that our cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy, we
        could wrap the word <i>very</i> in a strong
        element, which means that the word is to have strong(er)
        text formatting:</p>
      <code>&ltp&gtMy cat is &ltstrong&gtvery&lt/strong&gt grumpy.&lt/p&gt</code>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
    <header>Attributes</header>
    <article>
      <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
      <img class="code-example" src="images/code-example-3.png" alt="example of
        attribute">
      <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't
        appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute
        is an identifying name used to target the element with style
        information.</p>
      <p>An attribute should have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more
          than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces
          too.)</li>
        <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
        <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Boolean_Attributes">
    <header>Boolean Attributes</header>
    <article>
      <p>Sometimes you will see attributes written without values. This is
        entirely acceptable. These are called Boolean attributes. Boolean
        attributes can only have one value, which is generally the same as
        the attribute name. For example, consider the disabled
        attribute, which you can assign to form input elements. (You use this
        to <i>disable</i> the form input elements so the user can't make entries.
        The disabled elements typically have a grayed-out appearance.)
        For example:</p>
      <code>&ltinput type="text" disabled="disabled"&gt</code>
      <p>As shorthand, it is acceptable to write this as follows:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>&lt!-- using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text into the input box --&gt
    &ltinput type="text" disabled&gt

    &lt!-- text input is allowed, as it doesn't contain the disabled attribute --&gt
    &ltinput type="text"&gt</code>
      </pre>

    <article>
      <p>Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's
        examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt
    &lthtml&gt
      &lthead&gt
        &ltmeta charset="utf-8"&gt
        &lttitle&gtMy test page&lt/title&gt
      &lt/head&gt
      &ltbody&gt
        &ltp&gtThis is my page&lt/p&gt
      &lt/body&gt
    &lt/html&gt</code>
      </pre>
      <p>Here we have:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><code class="inline">&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</code>: The doctype. When HTML was young
          (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules
          that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. Doctypes
          used to look something like this:
          <pre>
            <code>&lt!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt</code>
          </pre>
          More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be
          included for everything else to work right. <code class="inline">&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</code>
          is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype.
          That is all you need to know!</li>
        <li><code class="inline">&lthtml&gt&lt/html&gt</code>: The <code class="inline">&lthtml&gt</code> element.
          This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes
          known as the root element.</li>
        <li><code class="inline">&lthead&gt&lt/head&gt</code>: The <code class="inline">&lthead&gt</code>
          element. This element acts as a container for eveything you want to
          include on the HTML page, <strong>that isn't the content</strong> the
          page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page
          description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content,
          character set declarations, and more. You'll learn more about this in
          the next article of the series.</li>
        <li><code class="inline">&ltmeta charset="utf-8"&gt</code>: This element specifies the
          character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most
          characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With
          this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might
          contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid
          some problems later.</li>
        <li><code class="inline">&lttitle&gt&lt/title&gt</code>: The <code class="inline">&lttitle&gt</code> element.
          This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the
          browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe
          the page when it is bookmarked.</li>
        <li><code class="inline">&ltbody&gt&lt/body&gt</code>: The <code class="inline">&ltbody&gt</code> element.
          This contains <i>all</i> the content that displays on the page, including
          text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
      <ol>

  <section class="main-section" id="HTML_Comments">
    <header>HTML Comments</header>
    <article>
      <p>HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore
        comments,  effectively making comments invisible to the user. The
        purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to
        explain your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a
        code base after being away for long enough that you don't completely
        remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are
        making changes and updates.</p>
      <p>To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers <code class="inline">&lt!--</code>
        and <code class="inline">--&gt</code>. For example:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>&ltp&gtI'm not inside a comment&lt/p&gt

&lt!-- &ltp&gtI am!&lt/p&gt --&gt</code>
      </pre>
      <p>As you can see below, only the first paragraph displays in the live output.</p>
      <p class="output">I'm not inside a comment</p>

      <p>You made it to the end of the article! We hope you enjoyed your tour of
        the basics of HTML.</p>
      <p>At this point, you should understand what HTML looks like, and how it
        works at a basic level. You should also be able to write a few elements
        and attributes. The subsequent articles of this module go further on
        some of the topics introduced here, as well as presenting other
        concepts of the language.</p>
